### Goal

The Genotyping result of 116 sample from CGR, generating vcf file as output for future genotype extraction.


### File and vcf location:

The file is located in T-drive with plink like inputs

`/DCEG/Projects/DataDelivery/GWAS_Data_Delivery/Mila_Urothelial_Samples_GDAConfluence_CGRGWAS-1123`

The Plink generated vcf file: 
`/DCEG/Branches/LTG/Prokunina/Parse_scRNA-seq/Sample_Genotyping`

### Code

- `transfer_to_vcf.md`: convert to vcf file using plink

- `VcfR.R`: In R, read vcf file using vcfR package to convert to genotype
