  - The GTEx v10 data are located in T-drive: `/Volumes/ifs/DCEG/Branches/LTG/Prokunina/GTEx_data/GTEx_analysis_v10`
      - Insdie the folder, the `/Volumes/ifs/DCEG/Branches/LTG/Prokunina/GTEx_data/GTEx_analysis_v10/QTL/eQTL_covariates/Bladder.v10.covariates.txt` maybe useful for adjusting lm() analysis
