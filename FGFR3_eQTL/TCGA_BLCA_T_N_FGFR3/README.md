### Goal: 
plot FGFR3 isoforms TPM expression of BLCA Tumor and nomral, and compare to GTEx v10 77 bladder tissue to see if the pattern change


### Code and data: 
The code is deposite here, the data are fomr T-drive: 
`/Volumes/ifs/DCEG/Branches/LTG/Prokunina/TCGA_data/Original source data Expression/UCSC_Toil_RNAseq_Recompute/transcript expression RNAseq_hg38/byCancerType`


Oscar has done the eQTL analysis for FGFR3 in BLCA in T-drive:`/Volumes/ifs/DCEG/Branches/LTG/Prokunina/TCGA_data/Data_for_FGFR3_project/QTL_analysis`

note that the expression value probalby not raw TPM, but the value is log2(TPM+1) or other normalization.
