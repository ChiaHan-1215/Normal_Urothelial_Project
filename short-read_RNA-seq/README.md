#### The RNA-seq notes of urothelial project
- Data source:
  - fastq files delivederd from CGR with QC sheets etc. the location is in T-drive: 
  `T:\DCEG\Projects\DataDelivery\Prokunina\TP0325-RS7-Urothelial-Samples-RNA-seq`
  - sample: 116 sample described in `Sample_table.md`
  - The RNA-seq QC shwwt, `114` sample

- Analysis piplie: following GTEx RNA-seq piepline: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gtex-pipeline/tree/master/rnaseq
  - or searching CGR github to see if there are good built piepline 
  - STAR alignmetn
  - RSEM to generated TPM
  - RseQC to QC
