# Normal_Urothelial Project 
The repo for Normal Urothelial sample project using Parse single cell with short/long process, RNA/DNA-seq

- Goal  
  Collecting normal bladder urothelical for building the database using RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq plus PacBio long read, and DNA-seq.
  
- Data  
  RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, and single cell PacBio long read RNA-seq, and common SNPs genotype table.
  
- Code  
  single cell:
  RNA seq:
